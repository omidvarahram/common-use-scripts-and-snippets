1	⭐⭐ (Intermediate)	React – useRef, useEffect	“You’re refactoring a dynamic credit-card payment form that autoscrolls to the next input as users type.  Occasionally, on low-end Android devices, the scroll jumps to the wrong field when the keyboard opens or a validation error appears.<br><br>Task: Explain how you would use useRef to keep a stable reference to every <TextInput>, then coordinate those refs inside a single useEffect so the correct field always receives focus after validation, even when the component re-renders.”*
2	⭐⭐	React – useContext, custom hooks, auth	“Our app must support role-based access (guest, basic, premium).  Downstream screens need can('PERFORM_X') without prop-drilling, and each role’s permissions can change at runtime when we refresh a remote policy file.<br><br>Task: Sketch the architecture (Context + provider + custom hook) you’d implement.  Explain how policy refreshes should propagate and how components can optimistically render while permissions are loading.”*
3	⭐⭐	TypeScript – flexible interfaces	“You’re writing a cross-platform analytics tracker called trackEvent.  On iOS it accepts (eventName: string, metadata?: Record<string, string>), on Android it also requires a priority enum, and on web you can batch an array of events.<br><br>Task: Write the TypeScript types (interfaces or overloads) so callers get proper IntelliSense and compilation errors for each platform build.”*
4	⭐⭐⭐	Jest – mocking imported class	“A helper CameraUploader class (in another file) wraps native upload APIs.  Your component uses new CameraUploader().upload(uri).  Unit tests shouldn’t hit the network.<br><br>Task: Show (or verbally outline) how you’d mock the class with Jest so you can assert it was constructed exactly once and that upload was called with the right URI.  Include setup/teardown considerations.”*
5	⭐⭐⭐	Testing strategy – coverage	“Your team’s CI gate requires 85 % statement coverage but a recent PR drops to 82 %.  The diff only touches styles and minor refactors, yet Jest flags reduced coverage.<br><br>Task: Explain in detail what ‘coverage’ measures (statements, branches, functions, lines), why a seemingly harmless change can reduce it, and how you’d investigate & decide whether to raise or lower the threshold.”*
6	⭐⭐⭐	React Native – native modules / bridge	“Design a secure QR-code scanner module that exposes scan() to JS and streams frames to native for decoding.  It must not block the JS thread and has to return a Promise with the decoded text or an error.<br><br>Task: Walk through the lifecycle of a call from JS ➜ native ➜ JS, noting thread hops, memory management, and how you’d surface cancellable scans to JS.”*
7	⭐⭐⭐	React Native – WebView ↔︎ RN comms	“Inside a RN app we load a trading dashboard in a WebView.  The web code needs real-time price quotes pushed from the native side, and user clicks in the WebView should open RN screens.<br><br>Task: Describe the postMessage / injectedJavaScript pattern (or the new WebView WebMessage API).  How do you structure a message protocol, ensure performance under high-frequency updates, and handle security (e.g., origin spoofing)?”*
8	⭐⭐⭐⭐	React – performance & hooks	“A high-frequency chat list re-renders on every incoming message, causing frame drops.  Messages belong to many rooms; only the active room list should update.<br><br>Task: Propose a refactor using useMemo, React.memo, or a virtualization library.  What profiling steps confirm your fix?”*
9	⭐⭐⭐⭐	TypeScript & React Native – compile-time safety	“You’re building a multilingual app where every string key must exist in all locale JSON files.  At runtime, t('screen.welcome') looks up the string.<br><br>Task: Show how you’d leverage TypeScript’s template-literal types & generics so invalid keys fail at compile time, even when JSON grows to thousands of entries.”*
10	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)	End-to-end architecture – CI/CD, testing, native code	“Our RN app ships both Android & iOS, uses CodePush for JS, and has native updates via the app stores.  A bug slipped through because a new JS release expected a native API only present in the latest binary build.<br><br>Task: Design a compatibility-guard strategy (type gating, runtime version checks, or feature flags) plus a CI workflow that prevents releasing JS bundles incompatible with the last published native build.  Explain trade-offs, tooling, and how you’d enforce it during PR review.”*
